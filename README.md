A checklist to the wasps of Peru (Hymenoptera, Aculeata)
========================================================

A checklist to the wasps of Peru (Hymenoptera, Aculeata). Data from GBIF http://www.gbif.org/dataset/640142cc-ff7e-49f3-902a-a0fd5a7a3560, published in ZooKeys http://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.15.196

The occurrence.txt file has decimal latitude and longitude values, but with a "," instead of a ".", and the meta.xml file labels the latitude and longitude columns as "verbatim" rather than "decimal". For the first commit of this repository I'd already replaced the ",". Note also that there are encoding issues with the file, many locality names have "?" in place of what is presumably an accented Latin letter.
